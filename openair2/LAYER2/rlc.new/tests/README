To run tests, simply type: make

Each test is made of:
  test.c      program of the test
  test.txt    expected output of the test

At runtime, we generate:
  test.run    actual output of the test

Only the output lines starting with "TEST" are taken into account.

The Makefile stops on the first actual output differing from the
expected output.
