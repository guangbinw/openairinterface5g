To run tests, simply type: make

Each test is made of:
  testXX.h      definition of the test
  testXX.txt    expected output of the test

At runtime, we generate:
  testXX.run    actual output of the test

test.c is the test driving program.

Only the output lines of the test program starting with "TEST" are
stored into testXX.txt and testXX.run.

A test is considered a success if testXX.txt and testXX.run are equal.

Only failed tests are reported.

To define a new test, use the number YY that is XX of max test + 1.
This is also the value 'test_count' + 1 with 'test_count' defined is
run_tests.sh.
Create the file testYY.h containing the test, then generate testYY.run
by running 'make all TEST=testYY' and copy testYY.run to testYY.txt. Be
sure that the output is correct.

The available instructions for a test are described at the top of test.c.
